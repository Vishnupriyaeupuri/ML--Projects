# ü§ñ Machine Learning Skills Showcase

Welcome to my machine learning repository! Here, I showcase my ML skills through various projects. Go through the work and let me know if you have any doubts or suggestions.

## üìÅ Projects Included

### 1. üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised ML Algorithms
In this self-initiated customer segmentation project, the primary goal was to categorize customers based on shared attributes. The project employed unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically KMeans clustering, to analyze customer data sourced from a groceries firm's database. The objective was to refine customer segmentation strategies, facilitating targeted marketing initiatives and customized product recommendations.

**Performance Summary:**
- **Clustering Technique**: KMeans Clustering
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.4
- **Model for Predicting Clusters**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy of Predictive Model**: 94%

### 2. üéì Student Dropout and Academic Success
This project focuses on predicting student dropout in higher education using machine learning algorithms. Dropout rates among students pose significant challenges to educational institutions. By analyzing demographic, economic, academic performance, and socio-economic factors, the project aims to develop predictive models that can identify students at risk of dropping out. The goal is to implement targeted interventions to improve retention strategies and enhance academic success.

**Technique Used**: SVM gave best results
- **Accuracy**: 90%
- **Precision**: 91%

Strategic deployment of interventions, informed by the SVM model's insights, should prioritize high-risk student profiles. This targeted approach aims to optimize resources and improve retention rates effectively.

### 3. üìâ Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for an electricity utility company, specifically targeting SME customers. High churn rates in this segment are impacting company revenue, primarily driven by price sensitivity. The objective is to develop a predictive model using XGBoost that identifies customers likely to churn. Strategic interventions, such as offering targeted monetary benefits to at-risk customers, aim to reduce churn and improve revenue retention.

**Performance Summary:**
- **Technique Used**: XG Boost Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 98%
- **Precision**: 99%

**Recommendations**: Strategic deployment of monetary benefits is effective but should be meticulously targeted towards high-value customers with a high probability of churn. Misallocation could adversely impact revenue.

### 4. üí∏ Loan Repayment Prediction
This project aims to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant attributes using Ensemble Learning Methods. The focus is on leveraging machine learning to enhance the accuracy of loan approval predictions, thereby optimizing the lending process for better risk management and customer satisfaction.

**Performance Summary:**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Achieved 84.58% accuracy.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved 84.7% accuracy.
- **Best Model**: Random Forest with 85% accuracy.

**Key Insights**: Attributes such as 'int rate', 'credit policy', 'fico', and 'inq.last.6mths' play crucial roles in determining loan approval outcomes.

### 5. üíª Laptop Price Predictor
The project aims to predict laptop prices based on detailed specifications using advanced machine learning algorithms. By leveraging these algorithms, consumers can make informed decisions when purchasing laptops.

**Performance Summary:**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Achieved an R2 score of 0.72. This model provides a baseline understanding of how individual features impact laptop prices.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Achieved an R2 score of 0.78. This ensemble method improves prediction accuracy by considering multiple decision trees.
- **Best Model**: XG Boost Regressor with an R2 score of 0.82. Known for its performance in handling complex relationships, XG Boost outperformed other models by capturing intricate dependencies among laptop specifications.

**Key Insights**: Attributes such as RAM size, processor type, and display technology play pivotal roles in determining laptop prices. Feature engineering techniques, such as creating interactions between RAM and processor types, and scaling features, significantly enhanced model performance. These insights empower consumers to understand the nuanced factors influencing laptop pricing, facilitating smarter purchasing decisions.
